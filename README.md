## Pokemon IV Breeding (Gen. 6) Probability Calculator

Pokemon are various creatures featured in several games starting from Pokemon versions Red, Blue, and Yellow in the year 1999.
In these games, trainers (players) can catch, train, and battle their Pokemon against other trainers.
Pokemon have six unique Individual Values (IVs) where each is of a fixed numerical value. These values help calculate the strength of said Pokemon.
Trainers can place their Pokemon in a daycare (in the game) to further strengthen their Pokemon and/or to breed for potentially stronger Pokemon.

This program follows the breeding mechanics for (the 6th generation) Pokemon versions:
 * Omega Ruby
 * Alpha Sapphire
 * X
 * Y
